\section{Introduction}
This verification evaluated in five different approaches that the design conforms to an excerpt of Subset-026 \cite{unisig_subset-026_2012}  related to the specification \cite{tsi-2012-88-eu} \cite{tsi-2012-696-eu}.  It is the first of three reports. It is performed before a design or development process is available. The design used for verification in this report is created and adapted to improve later results of verificatoin. Due to the applicable restrictions the results of the first report focus on the verificatoin itself rather than to give a verdict about conformity of design. All following reports will focus solely on the design provided by the work package "Modelling – Code Generation".

To ensure the correctness and consistency of a design model and its implementation, the
validation and verification has to be performed alongside with the modeling process. 
As the model and code of the EVC are produced by WP3,
thus this task will be performed repeatedly during WP3 and will provide
feedback to it.

This document presents the interim results of the first iteration of
verification and validation of formal model.
Since the actual formal model of the ETCS system, provided by WP3, has not
yet been initiated, no ``real'' input is currently applied.

\section{Institut Mines-Télécom: Verification of the Movement Authority}

\subsection{Introduction}

We focus on applying model-based formal methods on validation and verification
(V\&V) of the ETCS system.
An overview of our approach is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:approach}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}


In the openETCS project, the system requirement specifications are represented
by using SysML models. We validate and verify the models on two aspects,
model-level and execution-level, by using two model-based techniques:
model-checking and model-based testing.
At the model-level, V\&V is done through model-checking, by using IFx tool, of
IF formal models which are representations of the SysML models.
As model-checking techniques check exhaustively models, hence it may be
expensive in some special cases where we intend to check some properties of
models in some explicit conditions.
In such a case, model-based testing is a low-cost alternative.
At the execution-level, we encode the SysML models by Java simulators that are
then used to execute some tests.
We also illustrate the consistency of two aspects by applying test cases, that
are generated by TestGen-IF tool at the model-level, on our Java simulators,
i.e., all tests must give {\em pass} verdict

The automatic translations from SysML models to IF models to Java simulators are
being studied. Furthermore, as the actual models provided by WP3 have not yet
been initiated, we started with a formal model that is a finite state machine
augmented with continuous variables and guards. This model can be considered as
an abstract version of ETCS model and it can be refined in our future steps,
e.g., the MOVE function mode of the TRAIN can be refined to SHUNTING,
TRIP function modes of OBU in Subset-026.4.4.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Verification on IF model}
\subsubsection{Object of Verification}
The object of verification is an IF model representing the Movement Authority of
the train.

\subsubsection{Available Specification}
The Movement Authority is described in Subset-026, chapter 3.8. This chapter
gives (1) the definitions and structure of the movement authority, 
(2) the procedures of OBU to send a Movement Authority request to
the RBC and to receive a Movement Authority response from the RBC;
and (3) the use of Movement Authority on the OBU.

%Chapter 4.4 of Subset-026 describes in detail 16 different movement modes of
% OBU such as ISOLATION, TRIP, STAND BY, \ldots. At the moment, we generalize these modes onto
%two abstract modes: MOVE and STOP specifying when the train are moving or not.

\subsubsection{Detailed Verification Plan}

\paragraph{Goal} 
We intend firstly to model the Movement Authority of OBU described in
Subset-026-3.8. We then use the model to validate the safety
properties and to generate the test.




\paragraph{Method/Approach}


\paragraph{Means}

We consider an ETFSM (Extended Timed Finite State Machine) as a formal model
from which test cases for verifying the safety aspects of the developed
implementations can be automatically generated.
Formally, 
    an ETFSM is a tuple 
    $(S, s_0, E, T,  \Delta, v_0)$ where:
    $S$ is a non-empty finite set of states with $s_0 \in S$ as the
        initial state,
 $E$ is a finite set of events,
 $T$ is a set of transitions, 
 $\Delta \subset S \to S \times (\mathbb{N} \cup \{ \infty \})$ is timeout function, and
 $\vec{v}_0$ is the vector of initial values of the context variables.
The timeout function $\Delta$ limits an interval by which a trigger of
transition must occur (thus the transition will be fired). 
When the interval ends, the transition will be automatically fired in spite of
its trigger has not yet occurred.

  \caption{Extended Timed Finite State Machine of OBU}
  \label{fig:model}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



The formal model is then represented by IF description% or XML 
in order to be checked by using IF model-checker.
Test cases are generated by using TestGen-IF.

\textbf{Model Checking using IF.}
Model checking is an automatic technique for verifying finite-state reactive
systems. Using such techniques one could automatically check if the model
specifies most of the requirements of the system, such as the important safety
properties described in Task 4.4. Similar to proof techniques, in order to use
model checking to verify if the SFM (Semi-formal model) and FFM (fully formal
model) comply with the safety and function requirements,
the properties to be proven have to be identified and described. To implement
the use model checking, it is mandatory to specify the model using finite-state
reactive systems, and they should also provide an intuitive way to express the
properties to be model checked. The language for describing a formal model for
which corresponding model checkers exist should be selected and the set of
critical requirements to be verified need to be clearly identified. The proposed
model checking techniques should be supported in the selected tool chain. As
mentioned above, we are using IF-based specification to perform
the model checking of train safety properties.


\subsubsection{Results}



\paragraph{Summary}

We have provided a method to formally model the
movement authority requirements of the train using
finite state machines augmented with continuous variables (train position, speed, acceleration) and
time constraints. 

We have modeled OBU on Timed Extended Finite State Machine.
We have then used IF model checker to verify the
proposed formal model. 

During the modeling we discovered 3 inconsistencies, ambiguities and gaps in the specification
which we reported in~\cite{specfindingsTSP}.

\paragraph{Conclusions/Lessons Learned}

Currently, the obtained model can be considered as an abstract representation
of the system specification provided by the standard, i.e., the MOVE
function mode of the OBU can be refined to SHUNTING, TRIP function modes of
OBU in Subset-026.4.4.


\subsubsection{Next Steps}

On the one hand, we refine our formal model to take into account different
function modes of OBU.
In the other hand, we complete the automatic translations from the SysML
specification to the IF specification or to our Java simulator.

\subsection{Verification on Java simulator}

\subsubsection{Object of Verification}
Model of the Movement Authority converted from IF language to the simulator.

\subsubsection{Available Specification}
Conversion of the IF model described on the previous section.

\subsubsection{Detailed Verification Plan}

\paragraph{Goal} 
We intend firstly to model the Movement Authority of OBU described in
Subset-026-3.8. We then use the model to validate the safety
properties and to generate the test.

\paragraph{Method/Approach}

\paragraph{Means}

\textbf{Test Generation using TestGen-IF.}
When using model checkers the criteria for the model to be safe is that all the
safety properties should be checked. This is impossible, since the number of
safety properties could be infinite and thus, only some of them can be checked
through the above step.
For this reason, as a complementary approach, testing is commonly used. If the
corresponding model respects some requirements, i.e., only expected outputs are
produced to applied input sequences, to some extent, there is a confidence that
the models is safe. In order to derive ‘good’ tests a formal model should be
involved. It is known that only the FSM model where each input is followed by a
corresponding output allows automatic deriving finite tests with the guaranteed
fault coverage where the races between inputs and outputs can be easily avoided.
 Many authors for deriving finite tests with the guaranteed fault coverage turn
their model to some kind of an FSM (see,
e.g.,~\cite{springintveld2001testing,zymc11,Gromov2009}).

We decided to use TestGen-IF to automatically extract a set of test cases from
the formal model described in the IF language. We have identified a set of basic
requirements and we can describe them as IF properties.  Based on these
properties, the TestGen-IF tool automatically generates a set of test cases.
These test cases can be used to test if the model follows the requirements defined for the test generation.

\textbf{Adaptive Testing of Java simulator.}
For simulation, the artifacts should provide means to execute the model.  The
simulator must be automatically generated, so that, when run against test
scenarios (inputs/outputs for the model), we may conclude whether the model
follows the specification or not. In particular, it is important to define test
scenarios for the safety critical properties. The simulation should cover all states,
transitions, data-flow, and paths in the model. It would also be desirable to
include graphical representation of the simulation/model and also provide a
report of the visited components. Being able to trace the
requirements that are met during a simulation is also advisable to allow simple
requirement coverage.

Once we have a test suite generated by TestGen-IF, we execute them using our simulator. The simulator provides a trace of the execution of each test and the expected trace. By comparing both traces it is possible to identify problems with the model.


\subsubsection{Results}

\textbf{Summary}

We have provided a method to formally model the
requirements of the European Train Control System using finite state machines
augmented with continuous variables (train position, speed, acceleration) and
time constraints. 

We have modeled OBU on Timed Extended Finite State Machine.
With TestGen-IF we automatically generated a test suite that was used to verify our simulator.
%

\textbf{Evidence Produced}

By providing TestGen-IF with test objectives, we were able to automatically generate a test suite capable of verifying the properties related to them. Currently we have four different test objectives and with them we generated a suite of 22 tests. By providing more test objectives it is possible to generate more tests.
Each test constitutes a sequence of inputs (or period of time without an input) and expected outputs.

The tests generated were executed by the simulator. When executing a test, the simulator provides a file that compares the expected trace with trace that was simulated. If an inconsistency occurs, the test is considered failed. On our first execution we found some inconsistencies between the IF model and the model used by the simulator. After taking care of these inconsistencies we were able to execute all the tests pass.

\paragraph{Conclusions/Lessons Learned}
It is possible to find inconsistencies in a model using the Java simulator to execute tests. However, further testing is needed to determine the completeness of our test suite.

\subsubsection{Next Steps}
We plan to verify the fault coverage of these tests by executing Java
simulator against corresponding traces and Java Mutants. For this stage we used an older version of the model. A newer version is currently being updated and will be used on future activities.

\section{Systerel}

Three approaches of VnV  on formal models have been experimented and are
presented in this section:

\begin{enumerate}
\item VnV on classical B  model that cover software design level, in the objective to provide an open-source approach;
\item VnV on Event-B model that cover system level and support safety analysis;
\item VnV on Scade model that cover software design level.
\end{enumerate}

Classical B and Scade model specify the same example of Subset 026 "§5.9
Procedure on-Sight", Event-B model specifies the "Mangement of Radio
communication" function.

\section{Conclusion}

This Deliverable presented the formal \vv of Institut
Mines-Telecom, TWT GmbH Science \& Inovation, University of Bremen, University of Rostock, Systerel, LAAS-CNRS and INPT. 
The V\&V activities are focused on the System Requirement Specifications in
Subset-026 such as the Movement Authority (chap. 3.8), the Procedures (chap. 5),
the Management of the Radio Communication (chap. 3.5), the Speed and Distance
Monitoring (chap. 3.13), the Procedure on-Signt (chap. 5), and the Ceiling Speed Monitoring (part of the Speed and Distance Monitoring). 

These SRSs have been formalized in formal models such as  Extended Timed Finite
State Machine, Colored Petri-Net, SCADE, Classical B, Event B and Time Petri Net. 
The V\&V have been done on these models. They resulted
the correctness of the SRS but also
some inconsistencies, ambiguities and gaps in SRS being
repported in the Specification Findings.

The next steps are to refine the formal models and then to do the V\&V.
The specification findings will be updated during this process.
The test generation and then execution against the
simulators will be also focused.
