## Main usage:

- Test cases generation
 
## Summary
TestGen-IF is a test generation tool based on IF-2.0 simulator. It inputs a specification of Implementation Under Test (IUT) and a set of test purposes, and outputs a set of test cases.
The test cases are used to stimulate the IUT to validate its reaction. The tool can also represent behaviors of IUT as labelled transition system.

## Support and Survivability
# Applicability
## Key capabilities
## Input (which languages are targeted?)

- specification of an implementation under test, in IF (Intermediate Format)
- test purposes

## Output (Proof, code, other)

- timed test cases, in Aldebaran or TTCN format
- system behavior as labeled transition system, in Aldebaran format 
- information about the system execution (states, event, values of clocks, etc.), in XML format

## Main restrictions
## Manual or automated use of the tool


## Expertise level
Need to know about:

- IF language, to specify input models
