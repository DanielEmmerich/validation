\section{introduction}

The \bitwalker software can be considered to consist of a \emph{public}
and a \emph{private} part.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The public part consists of the \isoc data type \bitwalkertype and several \isoc functions
that can be used to manipulate objects this type.

\item
The private part consists of the functions \peek and \poke
that implemnet the core functionality of \bitwalker.
\end{itemize}

Before we informally specify \bitwalker
we introduce some auxiliary concepts and formulate general assumptions.
We would also like to point out the following:
When we speak in this document of \emph{integers},
then we refer to the infinite set of mathematical
integers $\{\ldots, -1, 0, 1, \ldots\}$
and not to one of the many finite representation provided by the type system of \isoc.

This distinction is important because it usually makes more sense
to describe the functionality of a piece of software in a more
asbtract way.
In a later step the realities of specific the \isoc type system
have to be taken into account.
