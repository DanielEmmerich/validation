\section{Introduction}

We introduce some auxiliary concepts and formulate general assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A \emph{bit stream} is an array containing elements of type \verb"uint8_t".

A bit stream of length $n$ contains $8n$ bits.

\item
A bit stream is \emph{valid} if the array is valid.

\item 
A bit stream can be indexed both by its array indices
and its \emph{bit indices}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bitstream-indices} shows the difference between 
array indices and bit indices in a bit stream.
The two bit indices, 0~and~14,
mark bit positions in the first and second array element, respectively.

\item
A \emph{bit sequence} is a consecutive sequence of bits within a bit stream
as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:bitsequence}.

\end{figure}

A bit sequence is given by the position of its first bit (a bit index in the bit stream)
and its \emph{length}, that is, the number of bits it contains.

\item A bit sequence of length $l$ that starts at bit index $p$ is \emph{valid}
     with respect to a bit stream of length $n$ if the following conditions are
     satisfied
     \begin{align*}
         0 &\leq p \leq 8n \\
         0 &\leq p + l \leq 8n
     \end{align*}

\item 
We assume that the C-types \texttt{unsigned int} and \texttt{int}
have a width of~32~bits.

\end{itemize}
