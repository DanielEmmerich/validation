\begin{abstract}
Starting from the original high-level description of the \bitwalker
software this document provides a more detailed, but still informal,
specification.
This specification attempts to be precise to the extend that
\begin{enumerate}
\item
testers are able to write unit tests for \bitwalker without the need to
look at its implementation

\item
it can serve as a base for a \emph{formal} specification in the
\acsl specification language of \framac.
\end{enumerate}
\end{abstract}
