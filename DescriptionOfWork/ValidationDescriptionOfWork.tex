  This work package will comprise the activities concerned with
  verification and validation within openETCS. This includes \vv of
  development artifacts, that is, showing that models and code
  produced correctly express or implement what they are supposed
  to. And also, methods and tools to perform such tasks will be
  evaluated with the goal of assembling a suitable method and tool
  chain to support a full development.

  The first output of this work package is a \vv strategy and
  plan. The plan identifies the \vv tasks to be done according to the
  openETCS life cycle (perhaps variants of the life cycle) chosen in
  WP~2. It proposes methods and means to perform the tasks and defines
  the orchestration of the single activities to a full \vv support of
  developing the EVC software.

  Both model and code of the EVC software are subjected to \vv as they
  are produced by WP~3, and the tools and methods proposed in the \vv
  plan as well as those newly developed or improved in WP~7 are
  applied and evaluated in the process. Findings from these steps are
  iteratively fed back to the respective work package.

  A dedicated activity studies the safety aspect of \vv. It takes into
  cosideration what the standards (mainly EN~50128 and EN~50129)
  mandate and defines how these requirements can be met by the
  combination of process, methods and tools.

  The results of the work package are summarized in a final report on
  \vv at the end of the project.
