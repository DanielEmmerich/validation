\subsubsection{Consideration of hardware and software constraints}



Hardware design is out of scope of the openETCS project. 
The considerations related to hardware are planned to be based on assumptions which have not yet been formulated.

\noindent 
Software constraints encompass 

\begin{itemize}
   \item restrictions implied by the coding standards and software design method
   \item timing\slash performance constraints
   \item memory constratints 
   \item constraints implied by 
         the interfacing system (e.g. decoder and encoder functions)
   \item the operating system
\end{itemize}
