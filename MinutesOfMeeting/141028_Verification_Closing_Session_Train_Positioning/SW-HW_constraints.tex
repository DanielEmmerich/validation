\subsubsection{Consideration of hardware and software constraints}



Hardware design is out of scope of the openETCS project. 
No hardware assumptions have been formulated so far.

\noindent 
Software constraints encompass 

\begin{itemize}
   \item constraints by the software design method
   \item restrictions implied by the coding standards
   \item timing\slash performance constraints
   \item memory constratints 
   \item constraints implied by 
         the interfacing system (e.g. decoder and encoder functions)
   \item the operating system
\end{itemize}
