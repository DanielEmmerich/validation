\subsubsection{Consideration of hardware and software constraints}



Hardware consideration are not a real part of openETCS.
Nevertheless, known constraints of existing hardware should be explicitely
formulated and taken into account.

\noindent 
Software constraints encompass 

\begin{itemize}
   \item restrictions implied by the coding standards and software design method
   \item timing\slash performance constraints
   \item memory constratints 
   \item constraints implied by 
         the interfacing system (e.g. decoder and encoder functions)
   \item the operating system
\end{itemize}
