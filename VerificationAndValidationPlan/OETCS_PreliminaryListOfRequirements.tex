%Preliminary List of Requirements used for openETCS
\subsection{Preliminary List of Relevant Requirements}
"When designing a new on-board Control-Command and Signalling subsystem or when performing a major modification/upgrade of an existing subsystem where the application of the TSI \footnote{Technical Specification of Iteroperability/Control-Command and Signalling} is required[...]" \footnote{Guide for the application of the TSI for the Subsystem Control-Command and Signalling Trackside and On-board, ERA/GUI/07-2011/INT}

\subsubsection{Methodology of Extracting Requirements from Legal Reference}
The possible relevant requirements were identified starting out from the table \ref{tab:HighLevelRequirements} documents. 
The document [1] amended with document [2] represents the current decisions taken by the European Commission concerning 'High-speed rail system (HS) and conventional rail system (CR)' in its subsystem 'control-command and signalling'.
These documents will be referenced as TSI/CCS. 
The reference within the openETCS project will be the english version. 
From the total list of the mandatory requirements mentioned and referenced within the TSI/CCS the relevant requirements were identified  according to the scope 'functional On-Board Unit' of openETCS.
These requirements were then categorised to 
\begin{itemize}
\item central requirements documents, direclty referenced with on-board functionality
\item interface related requirements documents
\end{itemize}  
not taking into account that within the interface related requirements there may be functionality for central requirements   

\subsubsection{Requirements Formulated Within the TSI}
Still requirements explicitly formulated within the TSI and not being referenced within the TSI has to 

And taking the following hypothesis in account:
\begin{itemize} 
	\item ETCS Level 2 is not excluded.
	\item Class B Systems are not excluded.
\end{itemize}
The hypothesis shall be validated taking in account the openETCS operational scenarios.

\subsubsection{Disclaimer} 
The boundaries of the functional On-Board Unit within openETCS are not yet defined thus making this first draft document a not yet consolidated and non final or complete list of possible relevant requirements were extracted from the legal standards of table \ref{tab:HighLevelRequirements}.
